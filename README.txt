Welcome to BLDC2!
-----------------


Getting Started
---------------
Apply "BLDC2.bps" to clean (headered) copy of Super Mario World and save it in the main baserom folder as BLDC2.smc (not .sfc)

NOTE: it is important for all the metadata files have the same name as your rom file to work appropriately.


Baserom Notes
-------------
The baserom was built with Lunar Magic 3.31, to avoid possible problems related to Lunar Magic version it's recommended to make your level with that same version.


Documentation
-------------
The "Docs" folder will have all the information about the things included in the baserom.


Using AddMusicK
---------------
In order for the retry system's death SFX to work the included files for AddMusicK (in "AMK Files" folder) must be included in your project.
