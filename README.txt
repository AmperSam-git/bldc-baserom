Welcome to BLDC2!

Getting Started
---------------
Apply "BLDC2.bps" to clean (headered) copy of Super Mario World and save it in the main baserom folder as BLDC2.smc (not .sfc)

NOTE: it is important for all the metadata files have the same name as your rom file to work appropriately.


Baserom Notes
-------------
The baserom was built with Lunar Magic 3.31, to avoid possible problems related to Lunar Magic version it's recommended to make your level with that same version (3.31).


Documentation
-------------
The "Docs" folder in the main baserom directory has files with information about all the things included in the baserom. Please consult those before seeking assistance, they may already have answers.


Using AddMusicK
---------------
Adding custom music is permitted for this contest but in order for the retry system's death SFX to work, some files are included for AddMusicK (in "AMK Files" folder) ought to be included in your project. If you forget to include these it will be alright.
