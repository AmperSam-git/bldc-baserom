; Block Duplication Fix v1.5 by lolcats439 (Asar conversion and SA-1/SuperFX hybrid by LDA)
; Fixes the block duplication glitch

; The root cause of the glitch is that the sprite used for the glitch gets moved to the left or right
; by the code at $0191D0, which is the code that moves a sprite in case it gets stuck in a block,
; to try to get it unstuck; unfortunately, simply NOPing it out makes the sprite disappear when
; it is inside a block, and for some reason can crash the rom. After this code runs, $9A and $98
; are set using the moved position instead of the correct position. The high nybble of the sprite's
; new x (+ 8) position is one more or one less than the block's actual x position, and then is used
; to spawn the bounce sprite. The block is then respawned using the coordinates of the bounce sprite,
; causing the block to be duplicated.

; Duplicating a block vertically is a little different, and is not caused by the stuck-sprite code.
; It happens when a throwable sprite clips through a block so much that it's y position is up
; to 2 pixels above the block's y position, but somehow still counts as a hit and triggers the
; bounce sprite. Since the high nybble of the sprite y position is then one less than the
; block's y position high nybble, the block is duplicated vertically.

; The fix is to store the sprite's x position to FreeRAM before the stuck sprite code runs,
; then get it back afterwards. For vertical duplication, the fix is to add 02 to the sprite's
; y position to increment the high nybble if necessary before clearing the low nybble.
