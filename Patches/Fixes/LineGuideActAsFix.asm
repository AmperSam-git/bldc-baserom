; Line-Guide "Acts Like" Fix, by imamelia
;
; This patch makes the line guide processing routine depend on the "acts like"
; setting of the Map16 tiles rather than the tile number.  This allows you to put
; line guide tiles anywhere on any Map16 page, as long as they act like the original
; tiles (or a tile set to act like one of the original tiles).
;
;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


; worldpeace's note:
; The vanilla code of line guide interaction sometimes tries to restore the sprite's position from backup RAM, even if they aren't properly stored.
; This results in teleportation of line-guided sprites. (Like other vanilla glitches, this has been regarded as a feature and utilized for vanilla tricks!)
; 
; The previous version assumed the correctness of Nintendo's code however, and accessed some invalid "acts like" values as a result.
; It caused game freezing in some emulators (e.g. higan v092); for those who're interested, the patch got the map16 value outside of the level area and repeated a loop infinitely.
; 
; My version fixes the freezing issue, as well as giving some extra option regarding behaviors of line guide.




!glitch_level = $03	; modify this as you want ($00-$03)


; Explanation: you can choose the frequency of odd behaviors, which are the following:
; 1) Map16 tiles in the page 1 (or acting like one) work as "line guide end".
; 2) Those tiles let line-guided sprites teleport to certain position. (see ft029's swissotel in vldcx)
; 
; These behaviors can be rarely observed in vanilla; only when the line-guided sprite is at a specific position which is decided by the map16 page of interacting tiles.
; 
; $03 = always allows those two behaviors regardless of the position of a line-guided sprite, like the previous version of the patch.
; $02 = always allows the "line guide end" behavior, but disallows the teleportation. (good for non-janky hacks)
; $01 = sparsely allows them as frequent as the true vanilla where there are only map16 pages 0 and 1. (might be useful for a restrictive compilation hack of something)
; $00 = disallows them completely. (another option for non-janky hacks)
