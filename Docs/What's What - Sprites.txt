Enhanced Normal Sprites
-----------------------

A number of vanilla sprites have been enhanced to have functionality enabled or their behaviour toggled by setting the extra bit.

To insert a sprite with an extra bit setting either use the "Edit > Insert manual..." menu action or press the "Insert" key while in Lunar Magic's Sprite editing mode.

Alternatively, you can place a sprite and Alt+Right-Click on the sprite to show the "Modify Sprite Manual (in hex)" window.
