The BLDC baserom has several UberASM features that you can activate in your levels via a custom object.

To insert a custom object either use the "Edit > Insert manual..." menu action or press the "Insert" key while in Lunar Magic's Object editing mode.

Custom objects can be activated by putting their value in the "Size/Type/Ext (0-FF)" field and multiple objects can be active in one level. For example, the demo level (105) has objects 9A, A1, A2 and A4 active.

Note: These custom objects will look garbled in Lunar Magic but they won't actually appear in game. The random tiles they are made up of may occassionally use an exit-enabled tile and potentially display a warning.
