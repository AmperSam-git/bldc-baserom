Multiple Midway Instructions
----------------------------

A feature of the included retry system is multiple midways. You can insert any number of multiple midways into your levels via a custom object command.

To insert a custom object either use the "Edit > Insert manual..." menu action or press the "Insert" key while in Lunar Magic's Object editing mode to display the "Add Object Manual (in hex)" dialog.

In this dialog, put "2D" as the "Command" value for every custom midway object you insert. The "Extension (00-FFx)" field is where you will configure the object for the various types of multiple midways. The following value ranges correspond to those different types of midways:


0000-0FFF - Secondary Entrances
-------------------------------
This will save your midway but Mario will respawn at a Secondary Entrance value specified, e.g. 0106 will respawn Mario at secondary entrance 106 (in any level).

NOTE: If the Secondary Entrance does not exist, this will fail.


4000-4FFF - Main Entrances
--------------------------
The checkpoint will save your progress but Mario will respawn at the "Main Entrance" of a level as specified in Lunar Magic, e.g. "4106" will respawn Mario at the start of level 106.

NOTE: You can't set the midway object to be the main level entrance of the level it is in. E.g. "4106" will not work in level 106.


5000-5FFF - Midway Entrances
----------------------------
The checkpoint will save your progress but Mario will respawn at the "Midway Entrance" of a level as specified in Lunar Magic, e.g. "5106" will respawn Mario at the midway of level 106 is placed in Lunar Magic.
