If you want to insert custom objects using the ObjecTool patch, and you're using Retry's Custom Midway Object feature (!use_custom_midway_bar = 1 in the settings) you'll need to make an edit before inserting the patch.
Open objectool.asm and remove these lines (they're towards the top of the file):

org $0DA415|!bank				; x6A615 (hijack normal object loading routine)
	autoclean JML NewNormObjects	; E2 30 AD 31 19
	NOP						;

After doing this, patch objectool.asm. After patching it for the first time, rerun UberASMTool, so that Retry can become aware of ObjecTool's presence in the ROM. After doing this, you can repatch both in any order without troubles.

One thing to keep in mind is that Retry will use slots 00-51 of the Custom Normal Objects for its custom midway bars, meaning that you can't use them in ObjecTool. You're free to use normal objects 52-FF, as well as Custom Extended Objects.

Additionally, if you want to remove Retry's custom midway bar while keeping ObjecTool, you'll need to place back the code that you removed in objectool.asm.
