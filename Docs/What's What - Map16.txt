- POINT OF ADVICE -
You should use Lunar Magic's "Add Objects" window as much as possible to construct your levels instead of placing tiles directly from map16. Objects that are composed of several tiles take up fewer bytes in-ROM when placed in levels over individual map16 tiles. Essentially each tile from map16 counts as its own object in the level and this can dramatically increase the bytesize of levels if there are many many tiles, and this will impact level load times.
