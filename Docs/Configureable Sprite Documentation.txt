Configurable Sprite Documentation
---------------------------------

Notes on particular sprites, some of this information can also be seen in the Lunar Magic sprite window
if you hover individual sprites in the list with with your pointer.


Any Line-Guided Sprite
----------------------
Extra byte 1            SS = Sprite number

Extra byte 2            XX = X offset for position sprite ($80-$FF = negative offset)

Extra byte 3            YY = Y offset for position sprite ($80-$FF = negative offset)

Extra byte 4            CC = Custom settings. Format: epP-SSSS
                        - SSSS: the state the sprite will be spawned in (using the $14C8 format).
                          (0 acts as 1 because state 0 doesn't make sense here).
                          State 1 (set with either 0 or 1) is init, which is what you usually want.
                          State 9 is carryable, useful for sprites like shells or throwblocks.
                        - e: if 1 (i.e. add 80 to the number), will set the extra bit for the spawned sprite.
                        - p: to be used with platforms: if set (i.e. add 40 to the number) Mario will move with
                        the platform instead of sliding on it. Note: it doesn't work with Carrot Lifts,
                        Keys and Boo Blocks.
                        - P: second platform option, which does the same thing as the p option but it's
                        recommended for sprites that use custom solid sprite code (for example, MarioFanGamer's
                        Numbered Platform sprite). Note: this option doesn't work for sprites that naturally
                        move horizontally. Also, this option is overriden by the p option: don't use them together.

Extra byte 5            SP = speed multiplier (+1)
                         - 00 = normal speed, 01 = double speed, etc. (max 7F)
                         - FF (or any negative value) = stationary (the sprite won't move at all)

Extra byte 7-8          E1-E4 = these 4 values set the 4 extra bytes for the other sprite (if custom).



Sprite Offsetter
----------------
Extra Bit               If clear, the displacement will add to the positions (move further right/down).
                        If set, the displacement will subtract from the positions (move further left/up).

Extra byte 1            Sprite number
                         - Normal or custom, if custom be sure the extra bit values in Extra Byte 2 are
                        appropriate to the sprite.

Extra byte 2            Sprite "extra bit":
                         - 00 or 01: normal sprite
                         - 02: custom sprite, extra bit clear
                         - 03: custom sprite, extra bit set

Extra byte 3            X displacement

Extra byte 4            Y displacement

Extra bytes 5-8         Extra bytes 1-4 of the custom sprite to spawn (if applicable)




Sprite Stacks
------------
Extra bytes 1-8         Sprite Number
                        - Use "FF" for an empty slot
                        - Use the Lunar Magic numbers for shells (DA-DE)

Extra byte 9            Marks sprites in the stack as custom
                         - the bits are in order from left to right with left being the bottom of
                        the stack,  e.g 80 (10000000, bitwise) would make just the bottom a custom
                        sprite.

Extra byte 10           Set the extra bit option of each sprite, e.g 80 (10000000, bitwise) would
                        set the extra bit for the bottom sprite.



X/Y Position Tracking Sprite
----------------------------

Extra bit               If clear, the spawned sprite is vanilla. If set, it's custom.

Extra byte 1            Sprite number to spawn.

Extra byte 2            Offset from Mario's X/Y position to keep the sprite at.
                        - Positive values ($00-$7F): offset to the right (or none if $00).
                        - Negative values ($FF-$80): offset to the left.
                        Note: if using the Y tracking option, you may want to use $10 as the offset to
                        make the sprite stay at Mario's feet position rather than his head.

Extra byte 3            Additional settings. Format: e......p
                         - e: if set, the extra bit in the spawned sprite will be set.
                         - p: 0 = track Mario's X position, 1 = track Mario's Y position.
                         - .: unused.

Extra bytes 4-7         These 4 values set the 4 extra bytes for the sprite spawned (only if it's custom).

Note: when inserting the sprite from the custom sprite list, there'll probably be some random
  values for the last 3 extra bytes. This is because the list doesn't actually support more
  than 4, so you'll have to change them manually (although if you're not using extra bytes
  for the spawned sprite you can leave random values there, as they won't be used).



Configureable Ball 'n' Chain
----------------------------
Extra Byte 1            Radius of the rotation (0-74)

Extra Byte 2            Angle divided by 32 (0-FF)
                        Example: $0800 = right /32 -> $40

Extra Byte 3            Speed
                         - 00-7F = counterclockwise
                         - 80-FF = clockwise

Extra Byte 4            First digit = momentum enabled - if not 0 spinning on ball changes speed
                        Second digit  = dynamic - see tables below for options



Configureable Boo Ring
----------------------
Extra Byte 1            Number of Boos ($0A: vanilla)

Extra Byte 2            Space between each Boo ($28: vailla)

Extra Byte 3            Radius ($50: vanilla)

Extra Byte 4            Speed ($10: vanilla)

Setting the extra bit will change the rotation direction (clockwise, counter-clockwise).


Customizable Scale Platform
---------------------------
Extra Byte 1            Width, how far apart the two platforms will be
                         - $40: vanilla's short width
                         - $80: vanilla's long width

Extra Byte 2            Speed, how quickly the platform falls when on it
                         - $08: vanilla's on platform speed
                         - Using negative speed will make the platform rise instead

Extra Byte 3            Return speed, how quickly the platform returns
                         - $02: vanilla's platform return speed
                         - Keep this speed positive, regardless of the other value



Floor Boo
---------
Extra Byte 1            Hide Time
                         - How long the boo stays hidden, in 4 frame increments

Extra Byte 2            Extend Time
                         - How many frames the boo stays out in 4 frame increments

Extra Byte 3            Movement Speed
                         - How quickly the boo moves around

Extra Byte 4            Wall Follow
                         - If not 0, boo moves along floors while hidden
