; 2 = instant retry (no prompt & play only the sfx: the fastest option; like "yes" is chosen automatically)
;       In this option, you can press start then select to exit the level.
; 3 = no retry prompt/respawn (vanilla death: as if "no" is chosen automatically, use this if you only want the multi-midway feature).
;
; Note: you can override this per sublevel (see "tables.asm") and also at any point by setting a certain RAM address (see "docs/ram_map.txt").
