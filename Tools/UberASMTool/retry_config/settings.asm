;========================================================================;
; Settings used by Retry. Feel free to change these.                     ;
;========================================================================;

;======================== Default Retry behavior ========================;

; 0 = retry prompt & play the vanilla death song when players die.
; 1 = retry prompt & play only the death sfx when players die (music won't be interrupted).
; 2 = instant retry (no prompt & play only the sfx: the fastest option; like "yes" is chosen automatically)
;     In this option, you can press start then select to exit the level.
; 3 = no retry prompt/respawn (vanilla death: as if "no" is chosen automatically, use this if you only want the multi-midway feature).
; Note: you can override this per sublevel (see "tables.asm") and also at any point by setting a certain RAM address (see "docs/ram_map.txt").
    !default_prompt_type = 3

;======================== QoL and Anti-Break ============================;

; How many lives to start a new save file with.
    !initial_lives = 99

; If 1, lives won't decrement when dying.
; Note: if 0, you can choose to have infinite lives in specific sublevels using the "lose_lives" table in "tables.asm".
    !infinite_lives = 1

; 0 = midways won't give Mario a mushroom.
; 1 = vanilla midway powerup behavior.
; Note: you can also change this on the fly (see "docs/ram_map.txt").
    !midway_powerup = 1

; Counterbreak options reset the corresponding counters/items when the player dies and when going to the Overworld.
; Useful for Kaizo and collab hacks.
    !counterbreak_yoshi = 0
    !counterbreak_powerup = 0
    !counterbreak_item_box = 0
    !counterbreak_coins = 0
    !counterbreak_bonus_stars = 0
    !counterbreak_score = 0

;======================== QoL fixes =====================================;

; If 1, level transitions will be much faster than usual.
    !fast_transitions = 1

; If 1, it fixes the issue where some sprites don't face Mario when entering a level for the first time.
; It's suggested to enable the fix to make sprite behavior consistent between the first and all the next level reloads.
    !initial_facing_fix = 1

; If 1, it fixes the issue where dying in a level with the timer set to 0
; shows the "TIME UP!" message when exiting the level.
    !time_up_fix = 1

; If 1, it fixes the issue where you can drop the reserve item in the item box
; by pressing Select while Mario is dying or while the Retry prompt is shown.
    !item_box_fix = 1

; If 1, it fixes the bug where Mario's lives won't cap at 99 when the status bar is nuked
; (which would show a glitched amount on the OW and Mario will have a halo).
    !lives_overflow_fix = 1

; If 1, it fixes the weird behavior where levels 12E-13B always use the "No Yoshi Sign 2" intro
; regardless of the tileset / custom "No Yoshi Intro" patches.
    !no_yoshi_intro_fix = 1

; If 1, it removes the "Hurry up!" SFX and tempo hike effect that happens when reaching 100 seconds on the timer.
; If not disabled, the death song will be played when dying during the tempo hike effect (regardless of the settings), to reset the tempo of the song after respawning.
    !disable_hurry_up = 0

; This controls whether to freeze sprites during a level's pipe entrance (it doesn't affect other entrance types).
; 0 = don't freeze
; 1 = freeze (recommended)
; 2 = vanilla: freeze only if sprites were frozen when exiting the previous room (e.g. if you entered a pipe, but not if you entered a door).
;     This can be inconsistent if exiting and re-entering the level.
    !pipe_entrance_freeze = 1

; If 1, Start+Select out of a level is always possible.
; Otherwise, it's only possible with the instant Retry option, or with the Retry prompt with the "Exit" option disabled, or if the level is already beaten like vanilla.
    !always_start_select = 1

; If 1, the camera won't scroll vertically during Mario's death animation.
    !death_camera_lock = 1

; If 1, DSX (dynamic) sprites status is reset on level load.
    !reset_dsx = 1

; 0 = vanilla (Boo Rings will retain the previous positions, not recommended for Kaizo).
; 1 = reset Boo Rings positions on death.
; 2 = reset Boo Rings positions on death and on level load.
    !reset_boo_rings = 1

;======================== SFX ===========================================;

; SFX to play when dying (!death_sfx = $00 -> no SFX).
; Only played if not playing the death song (for example, it's not played if the level uses vanilla death).
    !death_sfx = $36
    !death_sfx_addr = $1DFC|!addr

; The alternative death jingle which will be played after the !death_sfx when "no" is chosen in the prompt (only available when you're using AddmusicK).
; $01-$FE: custom song number, $FF = do not use this feature.
    !death_jingle_alt = $FF

; SFX to play when selecting an option in the prompt (!option_sfx = $00 -> no SFX).
    !option_sfx = $01
    !option_sfx_addr = $1DFC|!addr

; SFX to play when the prompt cursor moves (!cursor_sfx = $00 -> no SFX).
    !cursor_sfx = $06
    !cursor_sfx_addr = $1DFC|!addr

; SFX to play when getting a checkpoint through a room transition (!room_cp_sfx = $00 -> no SFX).
; This is meant as a way to inform the player that they just got a room checkpoint.
; If enabled, you can disable it in specific sublevels using the "disable_room_cp_sfx" table in "tables.asm".
    !room_cp_sfx = $05
    !room_cp_sfx_addr = $1DF9|!addr

; SFX to play when entering a level from the Overworld (!enter_level_sfx = $00 -> no SFX)
; similarly to what SMB3 does. If the SFX gets cut out, increase !enter_level_delay.
    !enter_level_sfx = $00
    !enter_level_sfx_addr = $1DFC|!addr
    !enter_level_delay = $02

;======================== Save and SRAM =================================;

; If 1, a custom SRAM expansion patch will be inserted as well.
; By default, it will save the custom checkpoint status and death counter to SRAM.
; To make your own stuff saved as well, check out the "save" table in "tables.asm".
    !sram_feature = 1

; If 1, the game will automatically save everytime a new checkpoint is obtained (when touching a midway or getting a cp on a room transition).
; If using this, make sure there's no softlocks (for example, a level is unbeatable from one of the checkpoints).
    !save_on_checkpoint = 0

; If 1, the game will automatically save after getting a game over.
; This can be useful when paired with the option of not reloading some data from SRAM after a game over (see "tables.asm"),
; if you want some things to retain even if the player got a game over before saving them (for example, the death counter).
; This ensures that they will be saved to SRAM when this happens.
    !save_after_game_over = 1

;======================== Custom Midways ================================;

; If 1, Retry will install a custom midway object in the ROM, insertable in levels by using object 2D.
; These objects allow you to have multiple midways in the same level, each with a different entrance.
; For more info on how to use them, check out "docs/midway_instruction/".
; Note: this can be used alongside ObjecTool, but you'll need to modify that patch a bit (see the "objectool_info.txt" file).
    !use_custom_midway_bar = 1

; If !use_custom_midway_bar = 1, it determines how many custom midways you can have in the same sublevel.
; The more you set, the more free ram is needed (4 bytes for each).
    !max_custom_midway_num = 8

;======================== Retry Prompt ==================================;

; If 1, the prompt will show up immediately after dying.
; Otherwise, it will show up halfway through (or right after, depending on !retry_death_animation)
; the death animation, but pressing A/B during it will skip the animation.
    !fast_prompt = 1

; 0 = don't play the death animation when using instant Retry or prompt
;     Note: for Retry prompt, part of the death animation still plays if not using !fast_prompt
; 1 = play the full death animation before showing the Retry prompt (note: make sure !fast_prompt = 0)
; 2 = play the full death animation before reloading the level with instant Retry
; 3 = play the full death animation in both cases (effects 1 and 2)
    !retry_death_animation = 0

; How fast the prompt expands/shrinks. It must evenly divide 72.
    !prompt_speed = 6

; 0 = sprites and animations won't freeze when the prompt is shown.

; 2 = sprites and all animations will freeze.
    !prompt_freeze = 2

; This controls what happens when hitting "Exit" on the Retry prompt:
; 0 = exit the level immediately and don't play the death music (except when the level music is sped up).
; 1 = exit the level immediately and play the death music (note that the vanilla song will be cut short).
; 2 = play the death animation and music, then exit the level.
; Note: when dying before going to Game Over, the vanilla animation will be always played regardless.
    !exit_animation = 2

; Set to 1 if you don't want the "Exit" option in the prompt.
; This will also allow the player to Start+Select when having the prompt.
; Note: you can also change this on the fly (see "docs/ram_map.txt").
    !no_exit_option = 1

; This defines a button that will count as hitting "Exit" on the menu while the prompt is shown.
; It could be handy if you disabled the exit option, but still want a quick way of exiting the level.
; By default it's "Select", set !exit_button = $00 to disable this.
; For more information on these values, see $7E0016 on the SMWCentral RAM Map.

; These will be overwritten dynamically when the prompt needs to show up.
; The default values should be fine in most cases, unless you're using some other patch that reserves tiles in SP1,
; for example: Sprite Status Bar, 32x32 Player Tilemap, lx5's Custom Powerups, lx5's Dynamic Spriteset System.
; In this case you may need to change some of them to avoid other tiles being overwritten.
; You can see the tile number in LM's 8x8 Tile Editor, by taking the value you see in the bottom left - $400 (e.g., "Tile 0x442" -> $42, "Tile 0x542" -> $142).
; Note: when the prompt box is enabled, !tile_curs and !tile_blk actually use 2 adjacent 8x8 tiles.
; For example, !tile_curs = $24 means both $24 and $25 will be overwritten.
; Also, obviously these aren't used if you don't use the Retry prompt.
