; Walljump/Note Block Glitch Fix by lolcats439 (SA-1/SuperFX hybrid by LDA)
; fixes the wall jumping glitch and the note block-wall death glitch

; This patch moves some of SMW's anti-wall-clipping code to freespace, and calls it from different hijacks,
; so it runs before the "Mario is on ground" bit of $77 would get set, so that the bit doesn't get set
; when jumping at a wall. Then when trying to walljump, you can't "catch" the block anymore, because you
; don't clip inside the block for one frame.

; It fixes the note block clipping glitch by changing the blocked bits that will be set to $77 to 12
; (blocked from up and right) if it is 11 (blocked from up and left) and Mario is moving to the left.
; This would be a separate patch, but it needs to use the same hijack used to fix the walljumping glitch.
