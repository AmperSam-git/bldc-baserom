; Climbing Net Door on Subscreen Boundary Fix by Kevin
;
; This patch fixes the issue where net doors won't work properly when
; placed on a screen/subscreen boundary (some tiles won't be erased and
; restored when the door revolves).
;
; Note that when a net is placed on a boundary, it will be more likely to
; cause blank overflows (for example, black bars on top of the screen).
; If this happens, try patching my "Lunar Magic VRAM Optimization" patch.
;
; Since the original routine is completely rewritten, some ROM space is
; left unused (48 bytes at $00C39F) and it can be used by other patches.
