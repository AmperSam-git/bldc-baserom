;  SMM style enemy stacks by dtothefourth
;
;  This version connects downwards instead of upwards
;
;  Uses 8 extra bytes which determine the sprites in the stack from bottom to top
;  FF for an empty slot
;  Use the Lunar Magic numbers for shells (DA-DE)
;
; The 9th extra byte marks each sprite in the stack as a custom sprite
; The bits are in order from left to right with left being the bottom of the stack
; So 80 would make just the bottom a custom sprite
;
; The 10th extra byte is the same, but for the extra bit
;
