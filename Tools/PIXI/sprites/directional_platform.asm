; SMB3-like Directional Platform                                                ;
;   by KevinM                                                                   ;
;   optimized by Ice Man                                                        ;
; Description: a semisolid platform that starts moving in a certain direction   ;
;   when Mario steps on it, and then it changes direction every time Mario      ;
;   steps on it again. The current direction is shown by an arrow in the center ;
;   of the platform. It doesn't interact with other sprites or with objects.    ;
;                                                                               ;
; Usage:                                                                        ;
;   - If you want to tweak some properties, you can do by editing the values in ;
;     the next section.                                                         ;
;   - If you want it to use a different palette row, edit the "F1" value in the ;
;     cfg file (3rd number in 3rd row) to one of these values: F1, F3, F5, F7,  ;
;     F9, FB, FD, FF.                                                           ;
;   - Insert the sprite(s) with PIXI (there are 3 cfg files: the number in      ;
;     their name coincides with the tile length of the platform).               ;
;   - You can set the disappearing timer directly in LM using the "extension"   ;
;     field when you insert or edit the sprite. The value you write in that     ;
;     field will be equal to the timer (ranges from 0000 to FFFF). 0000 will    ;
;     make the platform never disappear.                                        ;
;   - Insert the ExGFX files provided. They contain the SMB3 plaforms gfx and   ;
;     the arrow GFX. ExGFX112 must be used in place of GFX12, and ExGFX113 in   ;
;     place of GFX13 (so you'll either use SP3 112 or SP3 113).                 ;
;     NOTE: the arrow gfx overrides some vanilla tiles (the yoshi eggs gfx in   ;
;     112, and part of the net sprite gfx in 113), so you won't be able to use  ;
;     them with these platforms.                                                ;
;                                                                               ;
; Uses extra bit: YES                                                           ;
;   - If the extra bit is not set, the disappear timer will always tick after   ;
;     Mario activates the platform.                                             ;
;   - If the extra bit is set, the disappear timer will only tick when Mario    ;
;     isn't touching the platform, and will reset when it touches it again.     ;
;                                                                               ;
; Extry Byte 1: defines intial direction it goes in. Valid values from 01-04    ;
; right = #$01 / left = #$02 / down = #$03 /up = #$04                           ;
; Extra Bytes 2&3: they define the low and high byte of the platform timer.     ;
;                                                                               ;
; Extra Property Byte 1: number of tiles of the platform - 2 (it's already set  ;
;   in the cfg files provided).                                                 ;
