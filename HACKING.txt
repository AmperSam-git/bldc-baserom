Here's the tl;dr for getting the baserom up and running for your project:

    1. Run "@initialize_baserom.bat" to set up the baserom with all the needed tools to be a happy hacker

    2. Place a copy of your (headered) copy of Super Mario World in the main baserom folder, renamed "clean.smc"

    3. In the LunarHelper folder, edit "config_baserom.txt" (and optionally the other config files) to your preference.

    4. Run LunarHelper.exe to rebuild the baserom after all your changes have been made and your preferences set

Happy hacking!
